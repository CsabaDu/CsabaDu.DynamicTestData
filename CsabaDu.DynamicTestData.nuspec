    <description>CsabaDu.DynamicTestData provides open-generic data types and easy-to-use methods to help creating general-purpose as well as specific strongly typed data-driven test case parameters dynamically, with literal test case descriptions to display in Visual Studio Test Explorer.

It consists of easy-to-use record types to initialize, store and proceed parameters of dynamic data-driven tests, and an extendable abstract DynamicDataSource base class with fully implemented methods to create specific object arrays of the data stored in TestData records. You get ready-to-use methods to use as enumeration members of the derived dynamic data source classes.

It is a lightweight and narrow library. It does not have outer dependencies so it is portable, you can use with any test framework in Visula Studio. However consider the limitations of its usage and extensibility mentioned where applicable.</description>
